## Highlights

- **Unified multi-agent tracking** — Claude Code + Codex + Kimi Code + OpenCode in one place, grouped by source
- **Status line integration** — Claude Code via official StatusLine API; **Codex industry-first faux statusline** (hook-injected two-line truecolor status — bringing an official-unsupported capability to Codex); Kimi Code via the official `status_line` API; **OpenCode via a TUI sidebar plugin** showing the current session's live usage
- **Live sidebar** — `tt sidebar` shows all active sessions (Claude Code + Codex + Kimi Code); `$tt-sidebar` in Codex or `/skill:tt-sidebar` in Kimi Code opens a current-session-only pane on the right at one-third width
- **Rate limit monitoring** — real-time 5h / 7d quota usage with reset countdown
- **Multi-dimensional cost analysis** — per-session, daily, weekly, monthly cost breakdown
- **Pricing resolution** -- litellm live pricing + built-in official-price fallback, including GPT-6 Astra, Claude Fable 5.1, Claude / OpenAI / Gemini / Grok and major Chinese models (Kimi / GLM / Qwen / Doubao / DeepSeek / MiniMax / MiMo); long-context tiers and DeepSeek peak/off-peak rates (weekends are fully off-peak) are calculated per request, with separate Codex cache-read and cache-write pricing. Unknown models use known family rates where available; unresolved models emit a missing-price warning
- **Session insights** — project, model, duration, message count per session
- **Unified multi-theme** — 6 themes (Catppuccin family + Nord + Dracula) shared across CLI reports and every agent's status line; switch with `tt theme`
- **Zero config** — auto-detects installed agents, reads local data directly
- **Privacy first** — all data stays local, no collection or upload

## StatusLine

`tt setup` auto-configures status lines for Claude Code, Codex, Kimi Code, and OpenCode, auto-upgraded when the scripts update.

### Claude Code (official API)

Built on the Claude Code official custom StatusLine API — **all data comes directly from local Claude, zero guesswork**.

> The status line takeover is **optional**: if you already have a custom statusLine, it is kept by default (you can also pick No in the wizard anytime), and report commands work regardless. Note: without the takeover, the CC subscription rate-limit section in `tt status` has no data source (CC quota is only persisted via the status line script).

<details>
<summary>Four-row layout field details</summary>

| Row | Field | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 1 | `[project](branch +12 -3)` | Project name (bold) + Git branch (`*` = uncommitted), with added/removed lines vs HEAD in parens |
| 1 | `Total: 1.2M` | Cumulative tokens consumed this session (input+output+cache, parsed from transcript) |
| 1 | `Cost: $35.51` | Session cost (from Claude Code itself, official billing, accurate) |
| 1 | `Code: +208 -8` | Lines of code written / removed by Claude this session (`+` green `-` red, same as git diff) |
| 2 | `Limit: 5h: ██░ 31% (1h19m)` | 5-hour sliding window quota (subscription only; reset countdown in parens) |
| 2 | `7d: ██░ 11% (5d8h)` | 7-day sliding window quota |
| 2 | `1.0M Ctx: ██░ 20%` | Total context window size and usage percentage |
| 3 | `Tokens: in 392k, out 937, cache 388k` | **Current context window** token breakdown (note: not session cumulative; changes on compact) |
| 3 | `Out TPS: 60 tokens/s` | Current-turn output token generation speed (includes thinking; idle frames keep last value) |
| 4 | `Model: Opus 4.8/xhigh/nofast` | Model / reasoning level / fast mode status |
| 4 | `Duration: 1h33m` | Current session elapsed time |
| 4 | `Remote: github` | Code repository host (top-level domain stripped) |

> When terminal width is limited, the display auto-degrades: first hides reset countdowns, then simplifies progress bars to plain percentages. **API mode** has no subscription quota, so row 2 shows only Ctx.

</details>

### Codex (faux statusline — industry-first)

Codex doesn't yet support custom StatusLine. Token Tracker injects a **faux statusline** via a hook — after each turn completes, two truecolor status lines are appended to the response. **This is a rare implementation that brings a status line to Codex despite no official support.**

![Codex StatusLine](assets/screenshot-statusline-codex.png)

**Two-line layout**:

- **L1** `[project](branch +A -D) | Total: <session tokens> | Model: <model reasoning>` — Total in orange, Model in red; third-party API providers (e.g. DeepSeek) have no subscription quota, so L1 also shows session Cost (estimated from built-in official rates using each request's timestamp and context tier)
- **L2** `Limit: 5h <bar> % (reset <ttl>) | 7d <bar> % (reset <ttl>) | <window> Ctx <bar> %` — quota is read from the current session / same model_provider, so multiple accounts and providers never cross-contaminate; the `Limit:` prefix is hidden when no quota data exists

Renders 24-bit truecolor, **does not enter the model context** (verified), and **follows the current theme** (same source as the CLI reports / CC status line; `tt theme` switches all three together). `tt unsetup` removes it.

### Kimi Code (official API)

Built on Kimi Code's official `status_line` API (`tui.toml`) — a single truecolor line:

`[project](branch* +A -D ?U) | Total: 21.2M | Cost: $9.08 | 5h: 18% | 7d: 15% | Model: K3/high/auto` (same style as the CC status line; 5h/7d quota comes from the cloud `/usages` endpoint, cached and refreshed in the background every 2 minutes)

- Project / branch / model / permission mode come from Kimi's official snapshot (the snapshot has no thinking-effort field — effort is read from the actual `thinkingEffort` of requests in the session wire); the branch segment's uncommitted +/− line counts and untracked files are computed via `git diff --numstat` + `git ls-files` (same as the CC status line); Total and Cost are accumulated **incrementally** from the session's `wire.jsonl` by the status-line script (offset-cached, only new bytes are read per run), priced with the built-in official Kimi rates
- Fully supported on macOS / Linux / Windows (Windows console GBK encoding and background-process detaching are both handled)
- An existing custom `status_line.command` is never overwritten by default (the wizard also lets you opt out); `tt unsetup` restores the exact prior state

### OpenCode (TUI sidebar panel)

OpenCode has no status-line interface, and token-tracker never injects into a session (injected text is re-read as model context and would pollute the prompt). Instead it uses the official TUI plugin slot API: `tt setup` installs a `tt-statusline.tsx` plugin into `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` and declares it in the `plugin` array of `~/.config/opencode/tui.json` (TUI plugins are not auto-scanned from the plugin dir; only `.ts`/`.js` are, so declaration is required). It renders a Token Tracker panel in the OpenCode session sidebar:

- project name (working directory) + Git branch
- `Total` session tokens and `Cost` equivalent cost (from OpenCode's own per-request pricing)
- detail row: `in` / `out` (incl. reasoning) / `cache r / w`
- `Model` and plugin version
- **OpenCode Go plan quota**: `5h / 1w / 1m` real usage

**Enable / remove**: `tt setup` installs it (the wizard asks when OpenCode is detected), `tt unsetup` removes it; a user-owned plugin file of the same name and the user's own `tui.json` plugin entries are never overwritten or deleted; a corrupt `tui.json` is never overwritten. Takes effect after restarting OpenCode. Session data comes from OpenCode's TUI state (state-driven refresh); zero extra runtime dependencies (`solid-js` / `@opentui/solid` are provided by the OpenCode plugin host).

### OpenCode Go plan quota (optional, recommended)

The `5h / 1w / 1m` rows at the bottom query the **official OpenCode Go (`opencode.ai` plan) `_server` RPC** for the real usage percentage and reset countdown, styled like the Claude Code status line (`█████░ 31% (1h19m)`), refreshed every 60 s; a request failure shows `?` and never breaks the rest of the panel.

Configure two fields in `~/.config/token-tracker/opencode-go.json`:

```json
{ "workspace_id": "wrk_xxxx", "auth_cookie": "Fe26.2*..." }
```

How to get them:

1. Sign in at <https://opencode.ai>, open your workspace/billing page — **`workspace_id`** is the `wrk_`-prefixed segment in the address bar URL (not the workspace display name)
2. Open DevTools → Application → Cookies, select the `opencode.ai` site, copy the full value of the cookie named **`auth`** (starts with `Fe26.2*`) as **`auth_cookie`**

> Security note: `auth_cookie` is a sensitive credential that lives only in the local `~/.config/token-tracker/opencode-go.json`, is never committed and never logged; do not paste the cookie or workspace_id into chats or shareable links. Delete the file to clear it — the panel then falls back to an "unconfigured" hint.

## Live Sidebar

Run `tt sidebar` in a narrow terminal pane for an all-session overview. In Codex, explicitly invoke `$tt-sidebar` (in Kimi Code: `/skill:tt-sidebar`) to automatically open a separate right-side pane at one-third width containing only the current session's complete prompt history, newest first.

`tt setup` installs the user-level Skill and keeps the faux-statusline `Stop` plus sidebar `UserPromptSubmit` hooks together in the user-level `hooks.json`. Review and trust new or changed Token Tracker hooks with `/hooks`; restart Codex if the new Skill does not appear immediately. The prompt hook only attempts a local FIFO write while a matching sidebar is open—there is no transcript polling, prompt persistence, or upload. iTerm2 no longer requires its Python API; if macOS requests Automation access on first use, allow the app running Codex / `tt` to control iTerm2 / Ghostty. Ghostty (macOS, ≥ 1.3.0) and tmux are supported as well. Native iTerm2 full screen rejects AppleScript column resizing, so exit full screen before invoking the Skill. `tt unsetup` removes the managed Skill and hooks without overwriting a user-owned skill of the same name.

For Kimi Code, `tt setup` installs the Skill to `~/.kimi-code/skills/tt-sidebar` and appends a managed `UserPromptSubmit` entry to the `[[hooks]]` array in `~/.kimi-code/config.toml` (only Token Tracker's own block is added or replaced; all other user config is preserved; the FIFO behavior matches Codex). Kimi Code sessions expose no session-id environment variable, so the launcher locates the current session as the most recently updated session whose `workDir` equals the current directory. The hook takes effect in new sessions.

## Reports at a Glance

`tt status` — last-5h real-time panel (merged overview + 5h/7d quota + recent sessions)

![Status](assets/screenshot.png)

`tt weekly` — weekly report: this-week card + daily-trend bars + weekly / project / model trends

![Weekly](assets/screenshot-weekly.png)

`tt monthly` — monthly report: this-month card + weekly bars + monthly trend + project / model breakdown

![Monthly](assets/screenshot-monthly.png)

`tt sessions` — last 20 sessions sorted by cost (use `--sort` to change field)

![Sessions](assets/screenshot-sessions.png)

## Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stormzhang/token-tracker/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script auto-picks the best install method (uv / pipx / private venv), sidesteps PEP 668, and never pollutes system Python.

> **Upgrade**: re-run the command above (the script is idempotent and pulls the latest), then run `tt setup` once when a release adds a new agent integration such as `$tt-sidebar`.
> **Uninstall**: `tt unsetup`

**Still on the old version after upgrading?** An old copy installed in another Python environment is likely shadowing the new one (common on Windows, or if you installed via `pip install` early on). Uninstall the old copy, then re-run the curl install once:

```bash
pip uninstall token-tracker
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stormzhang/token-tracker/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Usage

```bash
tt setup          # configure status lines and install the Codex / Kimi Code tt-sidebar Skill / hooks
tt                # last-12-months heatmap + top tri-section overview (= tt daily)
tt daily          # same (tt with no args enters daily)
tt status         # last-5h real-time panel
tt weekly         # weekly report
tt monthly        # monthly report
tt sessions       # last 20 session details (tt sessions <n> to change count, --sort to change order)
tt sidebar        # live all-session sidebar (--once prints one frame and exits)
tt theme          # view / switch color theme (show / list / set / preview)
tt unsetup        # uninstall and restore previous config
tt --version      # show version (-v / -V)
```

> In multi-agent setups, add `--claude` / `--codex` / `--kimi` / `--opencode` (mutually exclusive) to filter any report to a single agent — works for `status` / `daily` / `weekly` / `monthly` / `sessions`. E.g. `tt daily --opencode` renders only the OpenCode heatmap. Inside an agent session, `daily` / `weekly` already auto-follow the current agent; the explicit flag overrides that.

> 💡 `tt daily` is a GitHub-style token contribution heatmap (shaded green cells). In a Claude Code session, type `!tt daily` to see it in full color — commands you run yourself with `!` have their 24-bit true-color output rendered.

## Color Themes

6 built-in themes, **shared** across CLI reports and every agent's status line (CC / Codex / Kimi Code) — switching changes them all:

![Supported themes](assets/screenshot-themes.png)

| Theme | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `mocha` / `latte` / `frappe` / `macchiato` | Full Catppuccin (mocha/latte auto-picked by dark/light terminal) |
| `nord` | Nord |
| `dracula` | Dracula |

```bash
tt theme               # show current theme and its source
tt theme list          # list all themes with color swatches
tt theme preview nord  # preview a theme (CLI sample + status line sample)
tt theme set nord      # switch theme (persist + re-bake status line)
tt monthly --theme nord  # render any report in a theme temporarily (no persist, status line untouched)
```

- Choice persists to `~/.config/token-tracker/config.json`; priority: `--theme` flag > `TT_THEME` env var > config file > auto.
- Truecolor terminals get exact colors; terminals without truecolor (e.g. macOS Terminal.app) fall back to a **256-color approximation**.

## Advanced

### First-run wizard

The first time you run `tt` (or run `tt setup` in a standalone terminal), an **interactive wizard** kicks in — arrow keys to move, Enter to confirm:

1. **Pick a language** — 中文 / English (saved to `~/.config/token-tracker/config.json`)
2. **Pick a color theme** — 6 themes with an inline color swatch on each option
3. **Take over Claude Code status line** — Yes/No (only when Claude Code is detected; an existing custom statusLine is backed up first, and picking No leaves it untouched)
4. **Enable Codex faux statusline** — Yes/No (only when Codex is detected)
5. **Enable Kimi Code status line** — Yes/No (only when Kimi Code is detected; an existing custom `status_line.command` is never overwritten by default)
6. **Enable OpenCode status line** — Yes/No (only when OpenCode is detected; a user-owned plugin file of the same name is never overwritten)

CI / non-tty environments (Docker / scripts / `curl|bash`) auto-install with **recommended defaults**: language follows the system setting, theme mocha, components on by default but **an existing custom statusLine is never replaced**. To change anything later, just run `tt setup` again.

### Report Sorting

All report commands support `--sort` and `--asc/--desc` flags:

```bash
tt weekly --sort cost --desc    # sort by cost, descending
tt sessions --sort tokens --asc # sort by tokens, ascending
```

Available sort fields: `tokens` / `cost` / `messages` / `time` / `input` / `output`

## Data Sources

| Agent | Path | Format |
|-------|------|--------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/*/` | JSONL (per-message usage) |
| Codex | `~/.codex/sessions/` | JSONL + SQLite |
| Kimi Code | `~/.kimi-code/sessions/` | wire JSONL (per-turn increments) |
| OpenCode | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` | SQLite (`session` / `message` tables; WAL-safe parallel reads) |

Cross-platform paths: on Windows `~` resolves to `%USERPROFILE%`. Honors `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` / `CODEX_HOME` / `KIMI_CODE_HOME` / `XDG_DATA_HOME` (the official custom-directory env vars) when set.

Token Tracker is **read-only** — it never modifies any agent data.
